* fix the issue that causes the character to hang above ground sometimes

* add support for scaling images to the screen or smth

* animations

* spritemaps

* multi-sprite and multi-collision-box-objects ?

* invert the way obstacles work (make obstacles tell the characters how
  to behave)

  * possibly, represent obstacles as sets of bi- (or not) directionally
    impenetrable line segments

* change to a widescreen viewport (16:8, to be hip (yes, that's 2:1, of
  course I know that!))

* create a pyglet-based engine?
